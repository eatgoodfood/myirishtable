His passion for food began in his Da’s vegetable garden, was fostered at his mother’s table, and further ignited by his childhood travels in France. The end result is a super talented young Irish chef with real values and buckets of talent of whom we can be truly proud.”</p>

						        <p>“This is a scrumptious gathering of everything Irish. It has the haughty (foie gras with black pudding and pears) and the humble (cheese on toast), the familiar (a curing brine for ham) and the unusual (a homey dish called Dublin Coddle). Along the way you’ll meet Da and his garden and Mam and her array of stews. These are recipes you dare not live without.”</p>

This book is full of wonderful recipes to explore, from a Saint Patrick’s Day roast leg of lamb with herb pesto to simple, classic brown bread. In the fine spirit of Darina Allen, Cathal is preserving Irish foodways, celebrating their rich traditions, and breathing new life into them.”</p>

Reading this book could make anyone wish they were Irish. Cooking from it will make you feel as if you are.”</p>

Reading this cookbook is a bit like taking a trip through the rolling hills of the Emerald Isle -- one you're not quite ready to leave when you reach the end. Grab a pint of Guinness and prepare to fall in love.”</p>
